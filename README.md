              GitHub is used to manage our code and projects in a great manner.

      install git

       Then we have to run and configure it global

       then we have to run commands 
        I learn git and GitHub from this video of Sir Muhammad Umair Ahmad( (https://youtu.be/Stj0P5zSwcg ))
        following are the most useful commands:
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "your msg"
        git remote add origin link_of_your_repo
        git push origin main
